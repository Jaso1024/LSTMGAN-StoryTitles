# Generative Adversarial LSTM (GALSTM) Story Title Generator

This project aims to generate creative and captivating story titles using a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The generator is trained on a dataset of existing story titles, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish between generated titles and real ones. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce more realistic and diverse titles.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install these packages using pip


### Running the model

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Run the script to train the model and generate titles

## Generated Titles

Here are a few examples of titles generated by our model:
- "The Secret of the Lost City"
- "A Journey Through Time"
- "The Rise of the Shadow Queen"
- "The Fall of the Last Kingdom"

## Built With

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The deep learning library used
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Numeric computation library
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data manipulation library
